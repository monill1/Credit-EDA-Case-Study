# Credit-EDA-Case-Study

- In this case study, we will explore the application of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in a real-world business scenario of risk analytics within the banking and financial services industry. The scenario presented involves a consumer finance company that specializes in providing loans to urban customers. The company faces the challenge of approving loans for applicants with limited or non-existent credit history. The objective of this case study is to utilize EDA techniques to analyze patterns in the data to ensure that financially capable applicants are not rejected for loan approval. Furthermore, we aim to understand the key factors that drive loan default, which will be used for portfolio and risk assessment purposes. Two types of risks associated with loan approval will be considered, including potential loss of business if a likely repaying applicant is rejected, and financial loss if an applicant is prone to defaulting on loan payments.
